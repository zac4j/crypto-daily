To run the Flask application, go to the terminal and execute:

- `export FLASK_APP=src/app.py`
- `flask run`

The application should be accessible via this url:

`http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

The first file would be a text file that list the modules our application depends on. To do so execute:

``` bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
